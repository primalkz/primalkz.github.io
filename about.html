  <h1><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h1>
  
  <article>
    <h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I'm a developer! It all started with curiosity about how things work. I began by rooting my Redmi 1s in 8th grade, diving into Android custom ROMs, and that freedom to customize turned me into a developer. That curiosity grew into a love for open source software and the GNU/Linux ecosystem, which led me to squeeze every bit of performance out of my old potato PC. My first distro was Solus OS back in 2018.</p>
    <p>I met many similar minded people on Telegram, both on Android and Linux groups. I also met bugswriter (Suraj Kushwah) in 2020 in a group called GNU/Linux India before he started his new YouTube channel, where we had discussions about games with his friend Shivam. Suraj inspired me to tinker and use Linux the hard way. I was already trying out different distros and beautifying desktop setups on Linux. I riced a few setups, posted tutorials on YouTube and shared on Reddit, trying out Gentoo, Arch, Void, then Nix. I connected with some amazing people shoutout to my tg friends <a href="https://cyberknight777.dev" style="text-decoration: underline;">cyberknight777</a>, <a href="https://github.com/perosar" style="text-decoration: underline;">PeroSar(Ayush)</a>, <a href="https://frappe.io/about/mangesh-mane" style="text-decoration: underline;">mangesh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CyberSecByte" style="text-decoration: underline;">CyberSecByte</a> and more.</p>
    <p>I played around with editors like Vim and Emacs, learnt bash and system administration involuntarily, basically I picked it all up just by enjoying the process. Finally I settled down and came back with Arch, rocking it since then for gaming and everything. I use bspwm/dwm mainly on my desktop and Hyprland on my laptop.</p>
    
    <p>I used to be paranoid about privacy after consooming lots of Luke Smith & Richard Stallman, but let's be real following their philosophy completely is basically impossible without becoming socially secluded and living in a cave. I tried to propagate RMS's ideas during my college days but the FOSS ideology wasn't strong in my batch, but I did make one good friend install Linux <a href="https://github.com/amanhex" style="text-decoration: underline;">@amanhex</a> haha.</p>
    <p>You can find all my dotfiles at <a href="https://github.com/primalkz" style="text-decoration: underline;">https://github.com/primalkz</a> although the most recent one is <a href="https://github.com/primalkz/hyprland_dots" style="text-decoration: underline;">Hyprland</a>, but the others will still work. There's <a href="https://github.com/primalkz/xmonad" style="text-decoration: underline;">xmonad</a>, <a href="https://github.com/primalkz/suckless" style="text-decoration: underline;">suckless</a> repo for dwm and their software, <a href="https://github.com/primalkz/bspwm-dots" style="text-decoration: underline;">bspwm</a> dotfiles etc, and emacs config inside the <a href="https://github.com/primalkz/dotfiles" style="text-decoration: underline;">https://github.com/primalkz/dotfiles</a> repo.</p>
